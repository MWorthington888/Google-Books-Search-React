New York Times Google Book Search powered by React
---------------------------------------------------
The NYT Google Book Search is an app that allows users to search a GoogleAPI for book titles and save selected titles to a database.

-------------------------------
How it Works
-----------------
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### User input

On the home page, the user will enter a book title as a search string. This string will be used to scan the GoogleBooks API and return up to ten books with titles that match the string. These books are displayed for the user with the following info: title, description and a thumbnail picture of the book cover.

Included is a link of each book to Google's Book website that provides more information such as author bio, publisher information, reviews, contents and related books.

### Saving a book

There is a save button that allows a user to save any book to a database for later reference.
